            <p class="note">OPERATION AMEX WAS THE MOST KALASALA WE MANAGED. I WENT ALL THE WAY TO NEW YORK AND TOOK A FLIGHT TO MINNESOTA. THIS TIME WE ATE SO MUCH FOOD LIKE COOP AND CRUNCHEESE.
                EVERY TIME I WITH MY BABY IT'S SO MAGICAL AND I NEVER WANT TO LEAF. UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT GET KABBAGE OFFER WITH ALL OUR EFFORTS, BUT ITS OKAY BECAUSE I GOT SOMETHING EVEN BETTER!
